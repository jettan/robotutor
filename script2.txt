Hello everyone.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Intro}
Good afternoon. My name is Robo Tutor.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/HandOverLeft}
\pau=300\
Today I will be taking over the lecture for a short while.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
Throughout this presentation I will give you an introduction to robotics.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
The goal of this presentation is to give you a general overview about robots and how we work.

#Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/First}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

First, I will tell you about who we are.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
After that, I will show why you need us and what kind of jobs we can do.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowBiceps}
Finally, I will explain how we generally work.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointForward}
Throughout this presentation, I will ask you some questions to test how well you are paying attention.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
You should all have a turning point clicker.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowRight}
Please use this to answer the questions I present on the slides.


# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/First}
As I mentioned earlier, I will start by defining what a robot is.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
For starters I am, as you might have noticed, a robot.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
But the actual definition of a robot is somewhat less interesting.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
Technically, it is an embodiment of an electro mechanical machine with sensors and actuators that acts in real time.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
This means however that some appliances that you might not consider as robots, technically are.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Think}
Imagine for example your home thermostat, it contains sensors and actuators and acts in real time.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
But would you really consider that a real robot like me?
\pau=200\

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/First}
The definition I mentioned earlier is just one of many used to determine what a robot is, and it is perhaps a bit outdated.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
Let us start with a trivia question.
Do you think this is true or false?

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}

\pau=200\
The word robot is derived from a slavonic word, which means servitude.

#{disable pose changer}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointForward}
I give you 10 seconds to answer this question, then we will discuss the answers.

{turningpoint choice | You are correct! | That is incorrect. | Well, that is inconclusive! }

# Show correct answer.
{slide}
\pau=500\

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
The word robot is derived from the slavonic word robota which means drudgery or servitude.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/First}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Think}
It was first used in a science fiction play in 1921, meaning the origin of the word robot is a little more than 90 years old.

# Go to next slide.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
Let's see if you have paid attention earlier.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
\pau=500\
Which of the following is, according to the previously given definition, not a robot?

{turningpoint choice | I told you I am a robot. | That is correct. | You might think so, but a cruise control also has sensors and actuators that work in real time. | You can tele operate the mars rover, but it can also work autonomously | Well, it seems I have not been clear enough before. }

# Show correct answer.
{slide}
\pau=500\

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
The correct answer was the vacuum cleaner.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
It does have actuators, however it does not have any sensors.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
Yes, why would you need us?
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
I should make a good argument here or else you can throw me away.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
While humans get scared sometimes, we robots do not have feelings and feel no pain.
So we are fit to do certain tasks you can't do.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
Take for example the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, robots were widely used to clean up because they are unaffected by the radiation.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Think}
Unlike humans, we robots love repetitive tasks like boxing items and putting things together.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
For example, if there were no robots, there would be hardly any cars on the street.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
Prices would rise because they would need to be assembled manually.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SmallBow}
You are welcome.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/No}
Sometimes there just aren't enough humans to perform certain tasks.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
I would like to show you, my somewhat distant family.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointLeft}
On the left, you see the doctor of the family.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
He is often working together with a human doctor or surgeon to perform many difficult surgeries.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Nod}
This makes operating a lot easier for many doctors.
\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
Above doctor bot, there is the vacuum bot.

\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
This robot is programmed to clean the house and it can even detect filthy areas which needs more cleaning.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
This is an example of a more practical, every day use of robots.

\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
Below the vacuum bot there is a robot dog.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
This dog is meant for research in interacting with robots and for entertainment.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
Before I was created, this dog used to play football in the robocup league.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
For the last few years, I have been doing this instead.

\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointRight}
To the right, at the bottom, you see the Mars rover that landed on Mars in 2004.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Nod}
The Mars rover can be used manually, but it can also perform certain tasks autonomously and it is much cheaper than having people being send to Mars.
\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
Just above the Mars rover, you see a typical assembly robot.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
These robots help assemble many items, from cars to computers.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/No}
They do not have much intelligence, they just do as they are told through some sort of script.

\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointRight}
To the right of the assembly robot you see Asimo.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Think}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/LeanRight}
Asimo is a research project at Honda and is widely known for its abilities to walk up stairs and perform many jobs around the house.

\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
These are just some of the many examples of robots in every day life.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
Now, I will try to explain you how we work.
\pau=500\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/No}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
Although I can not explain how we work exactly, I will give you an overview of what we do to function.
\pau=400\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointRight}
In general, we robots are equipped with several sensors that can sense the world around us.
\pau=400\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
All information gathered by our sensors is then processed \pau=70\  by our processing units to decide what to do next.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Capisce}
Based on this decision, we then use our actuators to manipulate objects.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Think}
The decisions are based on the architecture that was defined for our behavior.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide} 

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PushAsideBoth}
All robots need some type of sensors to observe the world around us.
\pau=200\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
Some robots need more sensors than others.
\pau=200\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/RotatingCapisce}
For example, the assembly robot of several slides ago barely needs any sensors at all.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointForward}
Humans however, already have more than 700 sensors in one square inch of skin.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointRight}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
To the right, you can see what kind of sensors I need to function properly.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Clap}
For example, I need pressure sensors to check whether my feet are positioned correctly, and collision sensors to check if I bumped into something.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowBody}
There are tactile sensors all over my body to detect if someone is touching me.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowChest}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointForward}
On my chest, I have several sonar sensors to approximate the distance between me and some object in front of me.
\pau=200\
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowMic}
Like how you use your ears to listen, I have multiple microphones to do the same.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
Similarly to how you use your eyes to see, I use two cameras which I can use to see you.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
I have just told you what kind of sensors I have.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
But how many sensors do you think I have in total?

{turningpoint choice | You might think so, but it's a lot more than that | Getting close, but it's a little bit more than that. |  | Getting close, but it's somewhat less than that. | Well, it seems that your opinions are divided. }

# Show correct answer.
{slide}
\pau=500\

{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowBody}
The correct answer was C, I have 61 sensors in total.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/YouAndMe}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
Sensors give you, and me, a lot of information about our surroundings, but we need to determine what we do with this information.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Think}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
The rules that map input \pau=70\ to output will be discussed later, but the hardware that does this mapping is called, the processing unit.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
Processing units are helpful for determining states in the world, for example, my exact location and how I should navigate through a map.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/FromAToB}
To get from one point to another.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/RotatingCapisce}
Processing units also help me understand the images I receive from my cameras to detect things like faces and objects nearby.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
Or for example sensor fusion, which combines the input from a gyroscope, accelerometer and compass in to one better orientation value, which helps me determine where I am, and how I am moving.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
When the processing unit has processed the input, a decision follows, which could mean I have to move parts of my body.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Clap}
This is done using actuators.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
An actuator is basically anything to manipulate our world, for example my arms, my legs, etcetera.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/YouAndMe}
Your arms and mine too, are limited by what we call degrees of freedom.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
When a joint can rotate around one axis or move along that axis, that gives you one degree of freedom.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/FromAToB}
If you can rotate around multiple axes, you get multiple degrees of freedom.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
Take your wrist for example.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/LRUD}
You can rotate it up and down, left and right, and twist it, giving it three degrees of freedom.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
Let's see if you can now understand this somewhat more difficult example.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointForward}
How many degrees of freedom does your head have?
{behavior|robotutor/specific/LRUD}
Remember that your wrist can roll, pitch, and yaw.
Your head can do this too, but can it do more?
{behavior|robotutor/specific/First}
Every axis it can rotate or move along, counts as one degree of freedom.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
I give you again 10 seconds to think about it, so be quick.

{turningpoint choice | That would mean your head has the same freedom as your wrist, this is not true. | Not exactly. |  | Not exactly. | Yes, very good! | Well it seems there is no conclusive answer. I do admit, it is a difficult subject. }

# Show correct answer.
{slide}
\pau=500\

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
The correct answer was D, since your head can roll, pitch, and jaw, just like your wrist, but it can also move along the ex, y, and z \pau=70\ axes.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Nod}
This gives it a total of 6 degrees of freedom.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
Let us look at another example of degrees of freedom.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointForward}
Can you count the degrees of freedom on this entire robot \pau=70\ arm?
{behavior|robotutor/specific/First}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
The arm has multiple joints, and the number of degrees of freedom for the entire arm, is simply the sum of the degrees of freedom of all joints.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
Take a few seconds to think about it.

# Show correct answer.
{slide}
\pau=500\

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
The correct answer was 4 degrees of freedom, which I will show you now.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointRight}
Here you see a red circle around each joint of the robot arm.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/RotatingCapisce}
Each of these joints can rotate around one axis.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
Since there are 4 joints, the entire arm has 4 degrees of freedom.

\pau=1000\

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PushAsideBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
Now that you know how degrees of freedom work, let's have a short look on what we can actually do with actuators.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
With actuators, I can grab objects around me, or move around if needed.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
If my friends were here, I could even play soccer or dance together.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Clap}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/No}
This is just what I can do with my actuators though, there are even robots that can juggle or play ping pong, but I can not react fast enough.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PushAsideBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
Of course motors are not the only actuators that exist, but for me and most robots they are the most important ones. 

# More DEMO shizzle.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowChest}
To summarize the last few slides, robot control generally consists of getting input data from sensors.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowMic}
The data is then processed in the planning step to make decisions.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowBiceps}
Finally, actuators are activated to execute the planned action.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointForward}
These steps are generally called the sense think act cycle and in an abstract way, humans do this as well.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/RotatingCapisce}
Basically every robot architecture runs on this cycle, but the way the think step is implemented varies a lot.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
There are multiple approaches that allow robots to think in a simple manner.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/First}
One of these methods is the subsumption architecture.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
The idea of this architecture is that you define the difficult behaviour in multiple simple behaviour layers.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShakeHands}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
Each of these layers focuses on a certain goal of the agent and higher layers are increasingly abstract.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/FromAToB}
Each layer's goal subsumes that of the underlying layers.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadRight}
Meaning that for example, the decision to move forward by the eat food layer takes into account the decision of the lowest layer to avoid obstacles.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Clap}
In this architecture the higher levels do not need to worry about goals that are the focus of lower levels.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/RotatingCapisce}
Another architecture is called the layered approach.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/PushAsideBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Convince}
This architecture looks very similar to the subsumption architecture, but the main difference is that behaviors are organized in layers of abstraction.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ReverseCapisce}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowMic}
This way you have for example a reactive layer that handles all navigation tasks or a reflective layer that handles all the planning.

# Go to next slide.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}
\pau=1000\
{slide}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/YouAndMe}
We have now reviewed two types of architecture for robot control.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/SpreadBoth}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Think}
Which architecture do you think I am using right now?

{behavior|robotutor/specific/No}
The truth is that I am not using any architecture at all.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointOut}
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance}
Perhaps one of you can program me with a more sophisticated architecture so I can handle this world better.
