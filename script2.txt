# Slide 1.
Hello everyone, good afternoon. My name is Robo Tutor.
\pau=1000\

Today I will be taking over the lecture for a short while.
Throughout this presentation I will give you an introduction to robotics.

First, I will tell you about who we are.
After that, I will show why you need us and what kind of jobs we do.
Finally, I will explain you more in depth about how we work.

Throughout this presentation, I will ask you some questions to test how well you are paying attention.
Please answer them by picking the answer on your clicker.

As I mentioned earlier, I will start by defining what a robot is.

For starters I am, as you might have noticed, a robot.
But the actual definition of a robot is somewhat less interesting.
Technically it is an embodiment of an electro mechanical machine with sensors and actuators that acts in real time.
This means however that some appliances that you might not consider as robots, technically are.
Imagine for example your home thermostat, it contains sensors and actuators and acts in real time, but would you really consider that a real robot like me?

Is this true or false?

The word robot is derived from a slavonic word, which means servitude.

The word robot is derived from the slavonic word robota which means drudgery or servitude.
It was first used in a science fiction play in 1921.

Let's see if you have paid attention earlier.

Which of the following is according to the previously given definition not a robot?

{turningpoint choice | I told you I am a robot. | That is correct. | You might think so, but a cruise control also has sensors and actuators that work in real time. | You can tele operate the mars rover, but it can also work autonomously }

# Show correct answer.
{slide}
\pau=500\

The correct answer was the vacuum cleaner.
It does have actuators, however it does not have any sensors.
