The script grammar consists of normal written text to be spoken by the robot,
with the possibility to embed commands in the text.
The commands will be executed at the time the robot reaches that point in the speech synthesising.

It is not possible to embed commands in the middle of a word.
If a command is encountered in the middle of a word anyway,
it is executed after the word has been synthesised.

By using plain text with embedded commands, the scripts are easy to read and write,
and commands can be executed at the proper time with minimal effort on part of the script writer.
It also avoids the need to learn advanced scripting languages such as Python.

Commands are started by an opening curly bracket '{' and the name of the command.
The command name may optionally be followed by a pipe character '|' and pipe separated argument list.
Commands are always closed by a closing curly bracket '}'.

Command names may include lowercase alphabetical characters, digits and spaces.
Arguments themselves are parsed as scripts again,
which means that arguments can themselves include commands.
In this manner, commands can be used to conditionally execute other commands.

To prevent characters from having special meaning they can be escaped by prepending a backslash.
This is only required for curly brackets, the pipe character and literal backslashes.
Prepending any other character with a backslash is allowed, but not required.

Examples of valid commands are: {pose|stand} or {slide|5}, or {next slide}. The exact list of commands is not known yet.
