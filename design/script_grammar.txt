The script grammar consists of normal written text to be synthesized by the robot,
with the possibility to embed commands in the text.
The commands will be executed at the time the robot reaches that point in the speech synthesising.

It is not possible to embed commands in the middle of a word.
When that happens, the command will be executed at the end of the word.

Commands are started by an opening curly bracket '{' and the name of the command.
Commands may optionally be followed by a colon ':' and a comma separated argument list.
Commands are always closed by a closing curly bracket '}'.

Command names may include lowercase alphanumerical characters, digits and spaces.
Arguments may include any characters, although commas, backslashes and closing curly brackets have to be escaped
by prepending them with a backslash.
Prepending any other character with a backslash will result in that character as if no backslash was used.

An example of a valid command is: {pose:stand} or {slide:5}, or {next slide}.
