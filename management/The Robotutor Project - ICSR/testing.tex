The Robotutor has been put to the test in front of a real audience a number of times through its development. In general people are pleasantly suprised over the robots ability to capture the audiences attention and to convey information. The voice was beforehand considerd as a possible source of irritation, but the respondents widely agreed that this was not a problem. During the tests the importance of the robot's movement turned out to be even greater than anticipated. During any presentation body language is terribly important, and for the robot this is no different. However it remains difficult to make the NAO appear natural through subtle movements, effort has been made to ensure that the robot doesn't appear frozen and supports its text through gestures.
