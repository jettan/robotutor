The Robotutor software enables the NAO to interact with an audience in an engaging way. Using its flexibility it can be used in many different senarios, ranging from educational lectures to stand-up commedy. In all these roles it manages to capitvate its audience and inspire enthusiasm in people over the capabilities of robots.\\

There is still a lot of ground to cover for robotic teachers. The system that has been developed here is still largely based on a rigid script. To create a more autonomous robot, this script would have to be replaced with a more dynamical system. An important part of this would be spatial awareness, enabling the robot to locate the audience, the teacher and the beamer. Such a feature could be realised by processing the videostream from the NAO's internal camera or external cameras in the lecture room.
