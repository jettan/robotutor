\begin{abstract}
The aim of the RoboTutor project is to develop a Nao robot that is able to educate and entertain an audience. Key challenges are to maintain audience attention and to interact with the audience. As a first step towards this goal, a system has been developed that enables the Nao to present a lecture on robotics with a focus on itself as an example of a humanoid robot. The system enables a Nao to present, explain, and control a slide show and to dynamically change slides while presenting. Moreover, during the presentation the Nao interacts with its audience in various ways to keep them engaged and entertained by performing quizzes and demonstrating some of its capabilities.
