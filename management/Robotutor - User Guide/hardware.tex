Robotutor requires an Aldebaran NAO robot with an Intel CPU running software version 1.14. Other software versions might also work but are untested. A NAO with motorized fingers is recommended for added motion interaction.\\
\\
To control the robot and run the presentation, a local computer is also needed. This can be any device running a recent version of Windows. It must be capable of audio playback and have Microsoft Powerpoint installed. Other presentation software will not work. If the Turning Point audience response system will be used in the presentation, version 5.1 of its software must also be installed.
