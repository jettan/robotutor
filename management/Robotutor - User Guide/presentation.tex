The first step in creating a robotutor presentation is creating a regular slideshow in Microsoft PowerPoint. It can also include polling sildes made by the Turning Point software. The robot will later use this slideshow in his presentation. The next step is to create an presentation script. This is a text file in wich the robots behavior is described. Most importantly it contains the text that the robot will speak. Within this text commands can be embedded.


\section{Commands}
\subsection{slide}
The command "slide" can be used to control the slideshow. This command has 3 modes; it can be used without argument to go to the next slide, it can be used with a number to go to a specific slide, or it can be used with an +/- sign followed by a number to go to a slide relative to the current slide. See the following examples.


\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Command & Result\\ \hline
\{slide\}& Go to the next slide\\ 
\{slide|1\}  & Go to slide 1\\ 
\{slide|7\}  & Go to slide 7\\ 
\{slide|+1\} & Skip 1 slide ahead/Go to the next slide \\ 
\{slide|+8\} & Skip 8 slides ahead\\ 
\{slide|-5\} & Skip 5 slides backward\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Behaviors}
There are three types of behaviors that the Robotutor uses. The first type consists of special behaviours that are not meant to be used during the presentation, but to start or stop the robot.
The second type consists of specific behaviours. These are behaviours that contain specific gestures that may be used in the presentation, such as point to the left or the right, the NAO introducing itself, and the NAO indicating the position of it's sensors. In the script, these behaviours can be exectuted as in the following example: "{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}".
The third and last type of behaviours are the generic ones. The are small body movements that can be exectuted randomly throughout the presentation to make the robot look more lively.

The Robotutor can play wav files from it's internal memory using the command
