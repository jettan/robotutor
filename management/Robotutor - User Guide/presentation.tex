The first step in creating a robotutor presentation is creating a regular slideshow in Microsoft PowerPoint. It can also include polling sildes made by the Turning Point software. The robot will later use this slideshow in his presentation. The next step is to create an presentation script. This is a text file in wich the robots behavior is described. Most importantly it contains the text that the robot will speak. Within this text commands can be embedded.


\section{Commands}
\subsection{slide}
The command "slide" can be used to control the slideshow. This command has 3 modes; it can be used without argument to go to the next slide, it can be used with a number to go to a specific slide, or it can be used with an +/- sign followed by a number to go to a slide relative to the current slide. See the following examples.


\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Command & Result\\ \hline
\{slide\}& Go to the next slide\\ 
\{slide|1\}  & Go to slide 1\\ 
\{slide|7\}  & Go to slide 7\\ 
\{slide|+1\} & Skip 1 slide ahead/Go to the next slide \\ 
\{slide|+8\} & Skip 8 slides ahead\\ 
\{slide|-5\} & Skip 5 slides backward\\
