Hello everyone, good afternoon. My name is RoboTutor.
\pau=2000\

Today I will be taking over the lecture for a short while.
Throughout this presentation I will show you some of my skills!
I will start by showing you my body and talk a little bit about my hardware.
We will end this presentation with some trivia questions.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointOutCameras}
I have two cameras with which {behavior|robotutor/specific/Look} I can see everything in high definition.
This allows me to see the world around me and even recognize people and objects!
I can even see all of you here right now.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointOutMicrophones}
Using my four microphones I can recognize the location of where sound is coming from.
If I try my best, I can even recognize the words that you say.
Insert microphone demo for me please. Anass is going to do something awesome for the microphones!

As you can see, unlike many robots, I can walk with my two legs {behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance} and grab objects with two arms {behavior|robotutor/specific/Flex}, just like you can.
I can even sit down if I feel tired and stand up again, but I am not as good at this as you are.

In fact if I am in a good mood, I can even dance a little.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Dance}

Alright, that is enough exercise for now.

Ah yes, time for a little quiz.
How much do I cost?

Hum, let's see.
{turningpoint choice | I am not that cheap, I cost 16000 dollar | Almost, but I cost somewhat more, 10 times more | Exactly, that is correct | For that money I can buy myself a whole family guys, I cost only 16000 dollar}

Let's see what you thought.
{turningpoint choice | Penguins can't even fly, it was the hummingbird | Yes exactly, very good | They can dig their heads in the ground, that's it. It was the hummingbird. | How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? It was the hummingbird.}

This is a trick question, let's see.
{turningpoint choice | That is correct, who knew | Try the beach. It was 20 percent. | Sounds logical, but it is mostly rock. The correct answer was 20 percent. | Sounds logical, but it is mostly rock. The correct answer was 20 percent.}

This is another trick question.
{turningpoint choice | That is incorrect, it is a weird phenomenon called the Mpemba  effect | Exactly, it is a weird phenomenon called the Mpemba  effect}

Thank you for your attention!
