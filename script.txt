Hello everyone, good afternoon.
\pau=2000\
Today I will be presenting to you about me and my family.
First, I will talk about my history.
Then, I will tell something about myself.
{behavior|robotutor/short/Twinkle}{next slide}
My ancestors are created by Al-de-ba-ran Robotics.
Most of my brothers are playing soccer, while others are into dancing.

Me? I am a presenter.

Although I am not a living being, I can still sense the world like every body here.
I can see in color through my two high definition cameras. \pau=300\
If I try my best, I could even recognize some faces and remember them.

I can hear by using four microphones.
I understand many program languages like C++, Java and Python, but also human languages like English and French.
Normally, I can stay awake for 90 minutes without recharging my batteries.

My future is very bright.
I can be used in lab as an assistant, for research and for entertainment.

Thank you for your attention!

I will now let the professor take over.
