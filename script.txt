Hello everyone, good afternoon. My name is RoboTutor.
\pau=2000\

Today I will be taking over the lecture for a short while.
Throughout this presentation I will show you some of my skills!
I will start by showing you my body and talk a little bit about my hardware.
We will end this presentation with some trivia questions.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointOutCameras}
I have two cameras with which {behavior|robotutor/specific/Look} I can see everything in high definition.
This allows me to see the world around me and even recognize people and objects!
I can even see all of you here right now.

You there, on the front, you weren't sleeping were you?

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointOutMicrophones}
Using my four microphones I can recognize the location of where sound is coming from.
If I try my best, I can even recognize the words that you say.
Insert microphone demo for me please. Anass is going to do something awesome for the microphones!

As you can see, unlike many robots, I can walk with my two legs {behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance} and grab objects with two arms {behavior|robotutor/specific/Flex}, just like you can.
I can even sit down if I feel tired and stand up again, but I am not as good at this as you are.

In fact if I am in a good mood, I can even dance a little.

Alright, that is enough exercise for now.

Ah yes, time for a little quiz.
