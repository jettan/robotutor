Hello everyone, good afternoon. My name is RoboTutor.
\pau=2000\

Today I will be taking over the lecture for a short while.
Throughout this presentation I will show you some of my skills!
I will start by showing you my body and talk a little bit about my hardware.
We will end this presentation with some trivia questions.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointOutCameras}
I have two cameras with which {behavior|robotutor/specific/Look} I can see everything in high definition.
This allows me to see the world around me and even recognize people and objects!
I can even see all of you here right now.

Hummm, interesting.

You there, on the front, you weren't sleeping were you?

{behavior|robotutor/specific/PointOutMicrophones}
Using my four microphones I can recognize the location of where sound is coming from.
If I try my best, I can even recognize the words that you say.
Insert microphone demo for me please. Anass is going to do something awesome for the microphones!

As you can see, unlike many robots, I can walk with my two legs {behavior|robotutor/specific/Balance} and grab objects with two arms {behavior|robotutor/specific/Flex}, just like you can.
I can even sit down if I feel tired and stand up again, but I am not as good at this as you are.

In fact if I am in a good mood, I can even dance a little.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Dance}

Alright, that is enough exercise for now.

Ah yes, time for a little quiz.

  Wat kost ik? ($16.000)
  Welke vogel kan als enige achteruit vliegen? (Kolibrie)
  Uit hoeveel procent zand bestaat de Sahara? (20%)
  Wat bevriest eerder, koud water of warm water?

Today I will be presenting to you about me and my family.
First, I will talk about my history.
Then, I will tell something about myself.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}{slide}

My ancestors are created by Al-de-ba-ran Robotics.
Most of my brothers are playing soccer, while others are into dancing.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/Me}
Me? I am a presenter.

{behavior|robotutor/specific/Twinkle}{slide}
Although I am not a living being, I can still sense the world like every body here.
I can see in color through my two high definition cameras. \pau=300\
If I try my best, I could even recognize some faces and remember them.
\pau=300\

I can hear by using four microphones.
I understand many program languages like C++, Java and Python, but also human languages like English and French.
Normally, I can stay awake for 90 minutes without recharging my batteries.
{behavior|robotutor/specific/ShowRight}{slide}

My future is very bright.
I can be used in lab as an assistant, for research and for entertainment.

Thank you for your attention!
\pau=300\
I will now let the professor take over.
